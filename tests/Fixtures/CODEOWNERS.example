# Fixture for \CodeOwners\Tests\ParserTest, this example is taken from Github

# This is a comment.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @global-owner1 and @global-owner2 will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.
*       @global-owner1 @global-owner2

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies JS files, only @js-owner and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.
*.js    @js-owner # This is an inline comment.

# You can also use email addresses if you prefer. They'll be
# used to look up users just like we do for commit author
# emails.
*.go docs@example.com

# In this example, @doctocat owns any files in the build/logs
# directory at the root of the repository and any of its
# subdirectories.
/build/logs/ @doctocat

# The `docs/*` pattern will match files like
# `docs/getting-started.md` but not further nested files like
# `docs/build-app/troubleshooting.md`.
docs/*  docs@example.com

# In this example, @octocat owns any file in an apps directory
# anywhere in your repository.
apps/ @octocat

# In this example, @doctocat owns any file in the `/docs`
# directory in the root of your repository.
/docs/ @doctocat

# A leading "**" followed by a slash means match in all directories.
# For example, "**/foo" matches file or directory "foo" anywhere,
# the same as pattern "foo". "**/foo/bar" matches file or directory
# "bar" anywhere that is directly under directory "foo".
**/foo @doctocat

# A trailing "/**" matches everything inside.
# For example, "abc/**" matches all files inside directory "abc"
# with infinite depth.
abc/** @doctocat

# A slash followed by two consecutive asterisks then a slash ma
# zero or more directories. For example, "a/**/b" matches "a/b",
# "a/x/b", "a/x/y/b" and so on.
a/**/b @doctocat

# In this example nobody owns the files
# This line should be ignored by the parser.
